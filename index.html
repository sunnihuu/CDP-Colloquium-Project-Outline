    This project emerges from the intersection of <strong>urban data practices</strong>, 
    <strong>food justice movements</strong>, and <strong>design as inquiry</strong>. 
    It builds on traditions of using spatial tools, particularly GIS and footprint modeling, 
    to make hidden infrastructures visible and to expose the social and environmental costs embedded in everyday systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The focus lies on the urban <strong>food system</strong> and its associated <strong>foodprint</strong>:
      the carbon, water, and land impacts of food production, distribution, access, and waste. 
      These impacts are often invisible, yet spatially distributed and systemically produced. 
      Mapping them becomes a way to uncover how environmental burdens and urban inequalities are intertwined.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project will follow a lineage of <em>critical cartography</em> and <em>urban political ecology</em>, 
      where maps are not neutral representations but tools to question, interpret, and intervene. 
      The project draws from frameworks such as <strong>critical infrastructure studies</strong>, 
      <strong>food sovereignty</strong>, and <strong>urban metabolism</strong>, while aligning with 
      contemporary design approaches including <em>ecological data visualization</em> and 
      <em>community-centered urban prototyping</em>. It continues a trajectory of data-driven urbanism, 
      where making the invisible visible becomes a first step toward more just and embodied futures.

    <!-- Rhetorical argument section -->
    <div class="project-title">Rhetorical Argument</div>
    <div class="section-content">
      <p>
    This project argues that the true infrastructures of urban food systems are largely invisible, 
    yet they profoundly shape environmental outcomes, social inequalities, and cultural identities. 
    By making these hidden dynamics visible through mapping and design, we can challenge dominant narratives 
    that treat food as a neutral commodity and instead reveal the complex networks of labor, migration, 
    and ecological impact behind what we eat.  
  </p>
  <p>
    The project contends that understanding the “foodprint” is not only a matter of calculating carbon or water use, 
    but also of recognizing how spatial justice, cultural memory, and community agency are embedded in food flows. 
    Design here becomes a form of activism: a call to reimagine food infrastructures as equitable, legible, and edible, 
    inviting new possibilities for urban sustainability and justice.

    <!-- The challenge section -->
    <div class="project-title">The Challenge</div>
    <div class="section-content">ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Accessibility:</strong> 
      Food migration and distribution datasets are fragmented and often inconsistent across different cities or agencies.
      <br><em>Plan:</em> Compile data from public sources (NYC Open Data, USDA, UN FAO) and consider qualitative supplements via interviews or community mapping.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Technical Learning Curve:</strong> 
      Need to improve advanced data visualization (D3.js), GIS analytics, and API integrations.
      <br><em>Plan:</em> Complete targeted tutorials, use small weekly prototypes, and consult peers with stronger dev backgrounds.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Visual Communication:</strong> 
      Crafting a clear and engaging aesthetic that supports argumentation while handling complex multi-layer data.
      <br><em>Plan:</em> Reference best practices from <a href="https://www.datasketch.es" target="_blank">Datasketch</a>, <a href="https://polygraph.cool" target="_blank">Polygraph</a>, and <a href="https://pudding.cool" target="_blank">The Pudding</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Community Relationships:</strong> 
      Grounding the work in lived experience requires trust-building with cultural communities and food practitioners.
      <br><em>Plan:</em> Reach out to local mutual aid groups, urban gardens, or food policy councils in NYC neighborhoods.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Scope & Focus:</strong> 
      Balancing scale (global migration vs. hyperlocal mapping) without losing coherence.
      <br><em>Plan:</em> Prioritize one core migration case (e.g. the journey of rice or chili pepper) to anchor the interface and argument.
